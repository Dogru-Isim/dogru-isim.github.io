## Content

My personal thoughts about the place of LLMs in vulnerability research.

The main questions are:

- can LLMs improve productivity in vulnerability research
  
  - how should we handle false positives
  
  - how are LLMs useful in vulnerability research
  
  - how are LLMs NOT useful in vulnerability research

- how can we (hackers) use LLMs "the right way"
